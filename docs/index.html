The Riverstone Travels Collection

Coerthas "Dank"
    A stout brewed in the Coerthan highlands in various basement breweries, hiding away from pious eyes.
    Despite societal reform, the art of brewing is still frowned upon within the Ishgard city proper. Quality varies wildly.

Sharishja Qhakyisha
    This is something the ananta sell to travelers. We're not sure what's in it, but it tastes a bit like... herbal ale?
    Note: getting this stuff in larger quantities was a pain in the rear -  you better like it.

Thirteenth Batch
    Buscarron of Gridania brews a special wheat beer for off-duty Woodwailers. Every year the recipe is changed to prevent locals from becoming too fond of it, hence the increasing number.

Dai Coo Gain
    East Aldenar Trading Company rarely imports beverages, but instead prefers to commission localized copycat variant products. This transparent liquor mimics the taste of an age-old Hingan dinner aperitive.
